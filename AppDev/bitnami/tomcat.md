## Create a Bitnami account ##

Bitnami is a company that supplies pre – built images of common application stacks.  These can then be used to develop and run applications.
An extensive range of Bitnami images are available for deployment on the Oracle Cloud Platform IaaS Compute service.  The available stacks include application infrastructure components such as LAMP, Tomcat and Ruby.  The full range of images can be found [here](http://oracle.bitnami.com/).

In this exercise we’re going to walk through deployment of the Ruby image which includes both the Ruby runtime and Rails a popular web application framework that runs on it.
 
The first thing that we need is to log into Bitnami.  Go to http://bitnami.com/sign_in
