## Using Developer Cloud Service to build a SpringBoot application and deploying to Application Container Cloud Service ##

This lab will start in Developer Cloud Service, using its DevOps features to build a Springboot application, then automate the deployment towards Application Container Cloud service.

+ Step 1 (Only for new Cloud Accounts or Trials) : [Create and configure your Developer Cloud Service Instance](springboot-sample/devcsconfig.md)

+ Step 2 : [Set up your Oracle Developer Cloud Service project with a SpringBoot application](springboot-sample/create.devcs.project.md)
+ Step 3 : [Deploy SpringBoot demo application to Application Container Cloud](springboot-sample/devcs.accs.ci.md): Create continuous build integration using Oracle Developer Cloud Service

If you finished these first steps, you can experiment further in thep 3 and 4:
+ Step 4 : [Scale up/down Application Container Service using user interface and PaaS Service Manager (PSM) Command Line Interface (CLI) tool](accs-psm/README.md)
