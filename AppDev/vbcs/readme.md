# Visual Builder Cloud Service Lab #

## Using visual development to easily build an application

### Introduction ###

Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service is a visual development tool for creating web and mobile applications by simply dragging and dropping user interface (UI) components onto a page. You can create business objects with the click of a button, and you can add data by importing CSV files or XLS spreadsheets to your application. You don't need any programming experience to develop an application.

This lab will first showcase the development of a simple HR application, based on a "Department and an "Employee" data object.  Next we will see how you can connect to an external REST API, and finally how you can use VBCS to extend SaaS applications.

Developing a simple HR application 

You'll create a Human Resources (HR) application to list all employees and departments of your organization. Using the application, you can add, edit, or remove employees and departments from the database.
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
+ Create the HR Application web application
+ Edit the properties of the application and add the application logo, add tab icons, and update the copyright text
+ Create Employee and Department business objects
+ Create application form pages to add, edit, and view the data of Employee and Department business objects
+ Test the application in Test Application mode
+ Add data manually to the business objects
+ Import data from a CSV file

You'll create the business objects shown in this diagram.
