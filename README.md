During this day you will be able to experience the various cloud services from Oracle hands-on.  Below you find the link to all labs already available : 


## Application Development ##
+ [AppDev Infrastructure lab](AppDev/AppDevInfra.md) - Set up the infrastructure to run your applications : create a Database and Application Servers, either using DBaaS or JCS, or use Docker Container to spin up any conainer from the Docker repository
+ [AppDev Development lab](AppDev/devcs-docker/Dev2OKE.md) - In this lab, youâ€™ll learn how to build a Docker image for a Node.js REST service on Oracle Developer Cloud Service (DevCS), and push it to a Docker registrie such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry.  Then you will deploy your application on an OKE Managed Kubernetes cluster.


## Container Native labs ##
**Using Oracle Managed Kubernetes Engine and Serverless Functions**
+ [Setting up a Kubernetes cluster on Oracle Cloud and deploy an Angular Node application using Wercker CI/CD pipelines](AppDev/K8S/readme.md)
+ [Run your first serverless Function using FnProject](AppDev/functions/function2_lab.md)


## BlockChain ##
+ [Set up a Blockchain network, and experiment with some transactions and Smart Contracts](BlockChain/readme.md)

## Front-end JavaScript Development ##

[Developing Web Component Development with Oracle JET](https://github.com/geertjanw/ojet-training/blob/master/README.md)

## Low Code Development ##
+ [Use visual development to easily build sophisticated Web or Mobile apps](AppDev/vbcs/readme.md)
+ [Building an intelligent Banking Bot](Mobile/IntelligentBots/readme.md) - Define a simple ChatBot, create two intents and a few utterances.  Finally you'll train and test your bot to see how it works.


## Process Cloud Service ##
In this lab, you will create a business process using PCS. This Order Approvals process will be initiated when a user enters an order.
[Follow this link for the details](Process/readme.md)


## Integration ##

+ [Integration Cloud Service](Integration/readme.md) - 
This lab will show you how to set up integration between 2 systems simply using the drag & drop features of Integration Cloud Service.  In this exercise we will set up an integration between a RightNow instance and a generic REST service of a mobile Application.

+ [APIARY](Integration/APICS/APIPCS-DesignFirst.md) - 
The objective of this lab is to give you an overview of the Oracle APIARY Cloud Platform as an API Developer. 

+ [API Platform Cloud Service](Integration/APICS/APIPCS-Manager.md) - 
The objective of this lab is to give you a comprehensive overview of the Oracle API Platform Cloud Service as an API Manager.
