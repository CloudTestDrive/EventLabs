This Oracle Cloud project contains the lab materials for the Oracle Cloud Test Drive events organized in various locations.  Participants can experiment through these labs with a series of Oracle Cloud Services from the IaaS and PaaS family.  

More specifically, following topics are currently currently included in this project:

## Application Development labs ##
This chapter is composed of 2 labs :
+ [AppDev Infrastructure lab](https://github.com/CloudTestDrive/EventLabs/blob/master/AppDev/README.md) - Set up the infrastructure to run your applications : create a Compute instance running Tomcat on Ubuntu, create a JCS Weblogic instance and spin up a Docker Container with Glassfish
+ [AppDev Development lab](https://github.com/CloudTestDrive/EventLabs/blob/master/AppDev/README.md) - Building applications with DevOps: using Developer Cloud Service to build a SpringBoot application and deploying to Application Container Cloud Service


## Infrastructure-as-a-Service ##
This chapter regroups some of the steps from the various CTD labs to create a specific focus on IaaS services in particular.  In this lab, you will experience the folling services:
+ Compute CS
+ Container CS

[Follow this link for the details](IaaS/readme.md)

## Mobile Cloud Services ##
This chapter will help you understand the use of MCS, the Mobile Cloud Service.  As an end-result, you will develop a simple mobile application and install it on your Mobile phone.
