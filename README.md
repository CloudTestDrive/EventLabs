During this day you will be able to experience the various cloud services from Oracle hands-on.  Below you find the link to all labs already available : 


## Application Development ##
+ [AppDev Infrastructure lab](AppDev/AppDevInfra.md) - Set up the infrastructure to run your applications : create a Database and Application Servers, either using DBaaS or JCS, or use Docker Container to spin up any conainer from the Docker repository
+ [AppDev Development lab](AppDev/Develop.md) - Building applications with DevOps: using Developer Cloud Service to build a SpringBoot application and deploying to Application Container Cloud Service
+ [DevStar Lab](https://github.com/oracledevstar/devstarworkshop/blob/master/README.md) - Join a rebel squad, develop Microservices together and defeat the DevStar backend application


## Container Native labs ##
**First exercises to get acquainted with Containers: Oracle Container CLoud Service**
+ [Deploy a Tomcat Docker image](AppDev/container/tomcat_deploy.md)
+ [Create a new image based on the Docker GlassFish image](AppDev/container/glassfish_import.md)

**Advanced exercises with Wercker and Kubernetes**
+ [CI/CD with Container Pipelines, Container Registry and Kubernetes Cluster to deploy an Angular Node application](AppDev/K8S/readme.md)
+ [CI/CD with Wercker, Docker Registry and OCCS: Build a Node.js-MongoDB container application](AppDev/container/wercker.md)
+ [Run your first serverless Function using FnProject](AppDev/functions/readme.md)


## BlockChain ##
+ [Set up a Blockchaion network, and experiment with some transactions and Smart Contracts](BlockChain/readme.md)

## Low Code Development ##
+ [Develop a MAX Application](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E65774_01/tutorials/tut_mcs_max_short/tut_mcs_max_short_1a.html) - Develop a Mobile application using the Mobile Application Accelerator (MAX) utility from the Mobile Cloud Service

+ [Building an intelligent Banking Bot](Mobile/IntelligentBots/readme.md) - Define a simple ChatBot, create two intents and a few utterances.  Finally you'll train and test your bot to see how it works.


## Process Cloud Service ##
In this lab, you will create a business process using PCS. This Order Approvals process will be initiated when a user enters an order.
[Follow this link for the details](Process/readme.md)


## Integration ##

+ [Integration Cloud Service](Integration/readme.md) - 
This lab will show you how to set up integration between 2 systems simply using the drag & drop features of Integration Cloud Service.  In this exercise we will set up an integration between a RightNow instance and a generic REST service of a mobile Application.

+ [API Platform Cloud Service](Integration/APIPCS-Manager.md) - 
The objective of this lab is to give you a comprehensive overview of the Oracle API Platform Cloud Service as an API Manager. 

## Infrastructure-as-a-Service ##
This chapter regroups a subset of the exercises already detailed in the previous topics to create a specific focus on IaaS services only.  This covers Compute CS and Container CS.  [Follow this link for the details](IaaS/readme.md)
