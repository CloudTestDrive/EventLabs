# AI Development Lab #
### Introduction

In this lab, we will build a web application that will call an AI service that solves an image classification problem.

The service can classify faces in an image by emotional state.  

You will deploy the AI service used in the demo application to the Container Cloud Service.

Our demo application will allow a user to upload an image and send it to the service. You will deploy this application to the Application Container Cloud Service

+ Step 1 : [Deploy AI service as a container to the Container Cloud Service ](container.md)
+ Step 2 : [Deploy demo AI application to Application Container Cloud](applicationcontainer.md): Create continuous build integration using Oracle Developer Cloud Service
