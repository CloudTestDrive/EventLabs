# AI Development Lab - Step 2 #

## Introduction
In this lab we will clone some code from GitHub make a modification to point the application at our AI Service and then upload the application to the container cloud service. 

## Pre - requisite Creation of a Container Cloud Service
The instructors will have created a Application Container Cloud service for your team to use. The link to the Container Admin Console will be provided in the Access Document you will receive. If you are doing these labs on your own, make sure to first set up a running Application Container Cloud instance from the Cloud Services dashboard.

## Clone the base project

Open a command window on your local machine and clone the repositoy using hte following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/CloudTestDrive/faceclassificationfrontend.git
```

Navigate to the file. ```Js/viewModels/dashboard.js``` and on line *173* change the URL to point to the service you created in step one. For user 5 this should like like:
