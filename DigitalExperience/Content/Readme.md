### Chapter 3: The Desktop Application
Conversations, Editing and other collaboration features

In this chapter of the workshop we are going to show the desktop application and its integration with the cloud.

The desktop app keeps files and folders on your computer desktop synchronized with your files and folders in the cloud.

It's easy to do. Just install the client software. You set up an account and the software will set up a folder for you on your desktop, with the name you give the folder. You can choose the folders you want to sync, and they’re put into that desktop folder to be synced whenever the app starts. You can also directly add files and folders into your desktop folder and they’ll be added to Oracle Content & Experience Cloud Service. They’re available to use in your browser or a mobile device. All your information stays up-to-date while the sync client is running.

You can also set notifications, letting you know when the conversations you’re active in are changed. You can customize what notifications you’ll receive so you can follow only those conversations that are important to you. You can also share your files and folders, just like you do when you use a web browser.

One way of downloading the desktop application is to click on your account name and then click on Download Apps

![](./images/image44.png)

Select the version you want to download and install it.

Note: The CEC application is integrated with your Windows file browser. You can choose the folders you want to sync, and they’re put into that desktop folder to be synced whenever the app starts. You can also directly add files and folders into your desktop folder and they’ll be added to Oracle Content & Experience Cloud Service.
