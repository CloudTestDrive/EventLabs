In this chapter of the workshop we are going to show how to use Oracle CEC via a web browser and how to upload a file into a folder and share it afterwards

## Create a site from a template
This main CEC homepage is split into two pages

The Content page: 
You have access to all your documents and conversations from this screen
You can perform all the required action directly from the browser (share, move, create, delete, comment, organize, etc...)

![](./images/image3.png)

The Experience Page:
This is where you will be able to create/edit/update/publish your websites, themes, templates and applications

Click on the “Experience” tab

![](./images/image4.png)

Depending on your instance, you will be able to see existing websites.

![](./images/image5.png)

We will first have a look at one of this website.
We will then copy this website, and customize it in order to suit our Travel Request needs.

This will show you how easy it is to reuse an existing website, share and modify it and following your business requierements.

Open the properties for the SCS_Workshop_Base website and see what it looks like.
Select the website and click on Properties.

A template contains a theme. A theme defines the look and feel of the page. The template may have already some content inside. 
A template is required for the creation of a site.

You adjust the theme that resides within the template to adjust the look and feel of the website.
Templates are a very convenient way to create and maintain sites.
They are easy to export, share and modify between team members.
